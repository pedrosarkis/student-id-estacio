A clone of the student ID card from Estácio University. This way, I can get half-price tickets at the cinema.

The only view that matters is the mobile one, since that's what I need to show when I go to the cinema (obviously).

I created a shortcut using the iPhone's "Shortcuts" tool, where I can set the title and icon however I want, so I made it look exactly like the original Estácio app, which is called "Minha Estácio."

A loading screen that simulates the behavior when opening the app.

After the first loading screen, there's another loading screen with a spinner.
